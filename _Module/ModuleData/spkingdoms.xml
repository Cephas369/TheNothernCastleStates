             text="During the Empire's civil war, Duchess Meyla of Walneria emerged as a formidable leader. Known for her strategic acumen and diplomacy, Meyla aimed to expand her duchy’s influence. Recognizing her potential, the aging Emperor funded her ambitious expedition before his untimely death. Meyla led her forces through treacherous lands, establishing the Duchy of Walneria with Imperial support. The duchy became a key player in the conflict, with Meyla skillfully navigating the political landscape. Walneria’s prosperity attracted both Imperial and Vlandian merchants. Seeking to protect their interests, these factions forged strong alliances with the duchy, providing essential resources and mercenaries. This ensured Walneria’s military and economic strength. As the civil war raged, Meyla’s duchy became a refuge for those fleeing the conflict. Her ties with the merchants solidified her position, making Walneria a thriving hub of commerce and culture.">

Tyrion, a cunning and charismatic leader, secretly garnered support from the native tribes who longed for freedom from Sturgian control. Promising them autonomy and prosperity, he united these tribes under his banner. Leveraging his position, Tyrion also secured the loyalty of elite Imperial troops disillusioned with Sturgia. With their military expertise, he launched a series of rebellions, his forces, a blend of fierce native warriors and seasoned Imperial soldiers, struck swift and hard, toppling Sturgian garrisons and fortifications. After several decisive victories, Tyrion declared it's independence. The new kingdom named to honor the unity of its diverse peoples, was born from the ashes of rebellion. Tyrion established a council where native chieftains and Imperial commanders could voice their perspectives, ensuring balanced governance.">
